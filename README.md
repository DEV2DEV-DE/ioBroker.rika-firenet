## RIKA-Firenet adapter for ioBroker

Control your RIKA stoves

## Information
First initial release, only polling values from your stove. Setting-actions will follow soon.
Polling-intervall minimum is 1 minute so you do not appear to be a DOS-Attacker against their websites.
This Adapter was developed for my RIKA PARO, but should also work for other RIKA stoves.

Fill textboxes in Adapter-Config
* Username: (E-Mail for your Rika account)
* Password: (Password for your Rika account)
* Stove-ID: (go to your Rika account and find out)
* Polling-Interval: (min 1 Minute)
